                <p>I began my journey in Information Technology in 2018 the day I raised my right hand and enlisted as a 25B – IT Specialist in the U.S. Army. I didn’t know then how far that leap would take me, but I knew I was ready to build something bigger than myself.

By 2019, I was stationed in South Korea, thrown into the fire of help desk support in a high-tempo environment. It didn’t take long for me to stand out. Thanks to long nights troubleshooting, a genuine hunger to learn, and a drive to always do more than what was expected, I was promoted early—earning the role of IT Operations Manager as a Private First Class (PFC), something rarely seen at that rank.

That promotion unlocked a new chapter. I was handpicked by the networking team to become their Network Security Administrator, where I led small strike teams to deploy critical infrastructure updates across the peninsula. My role wasn’t just technical—it was strategic. I optimized hardware deployments, drove efficiency, and ensured mission success across multiple fronts. During downtime, I built a war chest of IT certifications, determined to be ready for whatever came next.

When I transitioned back stateside, the Army tapped me for another mission—this time as a COMSEC Manager at Fort Bliss, Texas. What started as an unfamiliar role became a defining experience. With a three-person team, I was responsible for delivering secure communications to over 40 personnel under tight deadlines and mission-critical conditions. I trained brigades, maintained faultless documentation, and ensured that not a single COMSEC-related task missed the mark. I didn’t just meet expectations—I made sure the mission never failed.

Deployment came next, just after the birth of my daughter. In Qatar, I led account management for over 1,000 users on high-side and low-side networks. I pioneered workstation automation processes that cut deployment delays to zero. My workstation imaging system turned a critical bottleneck into a model of streamlined efficiency—every user received a properly configured setup within a week.

By the time I left active duty, I knew one thing: my journey in tech and leadership wasn’t over—it was just shifting gears.

I accepted a Systems Administrator II position at TekSynap, where I dove into the world of ACAS, CDS, Linux, and VMware. I now manage VxRail clusters from the ground up, configuring roles, tightening access controls, and working hands-on with ESXi and command-line interfaces to optimize our virtual environments. Every day is an opportunity to learn, build, and secure the backbone of enterprise systems.

Yet I never stopped serving. I joined the New Mexico Army National Guard to continue leading and growing—this time as a future officer. I completed the Officer Candidate School program in March 2025 and am now awaiting a Signal slot to lead soldiers from the front. My long-term goal? Join the Cyber branch, where I can fuse my passion for tech, leadership, and strategy to defend the digital domain.

What I bring to the table is simple: unmatched drive, proven technical skill, a passion for project management, and a mindset shaped by service, precision, and resilience. Whether I’m configuring a secure network, leading a technical team, or managing mission-critical IT projects—I show up ready to win.
